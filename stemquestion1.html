<h1> Whats an easy way to stay safe online? </h1>
<h3> The very first way to stay safe online is to secure, tighten and never share any of your passwords unless it is 100% nessesary to do so. </h3>
<h3> The first easy way to stay safe online is to change all your passwords frequently (every 1- 2 months) and tighten it using tactics like this:
A combination of letters and numbers
Special charecters
Upper and lowercase letters
Doesnâ€™t  make sense as a word
Isn't a name.
</h3>
<p> <h3> A good tip is to only share images and information that your 100% happy having circulate around the internet because this is almost 100% what it is going to do. When you post something online it is never ever going to be actually deleted, all pictures and information is stored on servers.
